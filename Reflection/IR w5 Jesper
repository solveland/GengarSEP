What do I want to learn or understand better?

- This week I have spent time on learning and trying to implement code on a swipe functionality between the different tabs
in our application. I have not managed to deliver a working solution, however, and will carry the task with me into the next
sprint. I have also read up on KPI:s and brought a discussion regarding what values our current KPI:s might have for the team,
and if we would like to change some of them. Going into next sprint, my goal, other than finishing my last coding task, is
to learn more about CSS and how to connect it to Android Studious in order to take part in doing the final touch ups on the
graphics of our application.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- Seeing as my fellow group members will also take part in the work with CSS, I will do what I can to explain things to them
in case I know more about some certain functionality.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

-	I have taken part in discussions during our daily scrum meetings, but seeing as our process is pretty much in place right now
I have not contributed anything new.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

- As I could not get my code to work properly I have not yet delivered anything from last week. My goal is to, in the beginning
of the coming sprint, to finish this task with the help of a group member with better knowledge of programming. I have delivered
a proposition of KPI(success rate), which we after discussions with the teachers decided not to use seeing as it would hardly benefit
our scrum process. We have however learned more about why KPI:s might be useful thanks to it, and can use that knowledge in future projects.
