Induvidual reflection Daniel Aryan {

Vecka 1 {

what do I want to learn or understand better? 
  This is my first time using github or any shared repository for a development project. Therefore i want
  to learn the basics of working with git. During the coming week i will try to learn git better by watching/reading
  tutorials online and by asking my fellow teammates.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
  As an I-student, i will try to bring my marginal understanding of market capitalization to the group. By sharing my experience 
  from previous projects implementing the business model canvas or similar models i will try to make sure to ensure that the end product
  we produce together can be of value to someone. 
  I will also try to share my understanding of how to write quality code or how to improve the commited code
  with the group whenever possible. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 
  I will try to make sure that the team successfully implements the Scrum process. In order to do that, i will push for weekly reflection 
  meetings, daily scrums etc. I will also continuously try to estimate my own, and the group´s velocity in order to make sure we all
  take on appropriate amounts of work. 
 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
  For now, i will come up with and discuss our idea with the group. During this process i will try to shape the idea into something
  valuable and marketable according to the business model canvas. After that, i will contribute to the building of the backlog, estimate
  my own velocity and take on coding tasks. I will also test and evaluate the commited code together with the group.
