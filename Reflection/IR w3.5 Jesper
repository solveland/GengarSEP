What do I want to learn or understand better?

- Right now, I feel like I have gotten acquainted with the code, understanding how the XML and Java is connected and overall,
where the make changes to make the application do what I want it to do. With this knowledge I feel like I can focus more on 
the implementation of new technologies. I have also gotten acquainted with Git, through commiting my first changes to the program,
and I feel quite comfortable with how to work in the Git workflow.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

-	Seeing as we're mainly implementing code right now I feel that the other group members are more knowledgeable than me,
however, we present the changes we make to the rest of the group and in case someone has questions about my commits I gladly 
help them understand what they need to understand to understand my changes


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

-	As our last couple of weeks have been cut short by different breaks and examination periods, we have not worked in full sprints
and have mainly focused on getting our core functionality in place. I have made small changes to the Trello Backlog, for example when
we decided to add some smaller design changes. Other than that, though, we have not really added anything new to the Trello board
and my contributions have mainly been connected to communicating with the team and being an active part of discussing our progress.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

- I have now commited my first changes to the code, working with the design of the application and refactoring variables to increase
the readability of our code. Moving forward I'm looking forward to continuing adding to the code, learning new things and cooperating
with my fellow group members.
