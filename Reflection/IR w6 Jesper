What do I want to learn or understand better?

- This week the group in its entirety has mainly focused on getting our application in shape for demonstration rather than
implementing new, complex features. Our reasoning for this was that new features could end up causing problems for the
application that we would not have time to fix. We were also satisfied with our core product and did not feel that there
was a great need for additional features. My responsebility during the week was making sure that the naming and language of 
the application was coherent. Together with the group, I also made sure everything worked properly in its entirety and prepared
the demonstration.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- During the week my main contribution to teaching my fellow team members was during the discussions about demonstrating
the applications functionality. I used my experience in presenting things by pushing for a logical runthrough which would
clearly demonstrate how the application could give value to the different parties that are meant to use our application. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

-	I have taken part in discussions during our daily scrum meetings, but seeing as our process is pretty much in place right now
I have not contributed anything new.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

- I have worked on tidying up the applications appearance, and with the demonstration of the application.
