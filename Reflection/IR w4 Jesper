What do I want to learn or understand better?

- The last week has been really trash for me. Ontop of working around the clock to finish my bachelor's thesis I have had
a fever that doesn't want to give in. I am really feeling like my effort to the group deliveries have been suffering due to
these things and I want that to change asap. What I mainly feel like I'm not delivering is code for the project, and my main
objective from now on is to make sure I will do this.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- I wish to teach the other group members more about the KPI:s we've decided upon, as establishing these are one of my 
tasks for the week.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

-	This week I have not contributed whatsoever to the groups work with SCRUM due to circumstances, but I have been kept in the loop
by the other team members, and I'm thankful for that.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

- None.
