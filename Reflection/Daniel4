Individual reflection 4, Daniel Aryan{

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I still feel like i´ve been quite inactive during this sprint, as my given tasks were quite small and as we did not have many relevant
user-stories to claim. Therefore i can´t really say that i´ve learnt much this week either, except maybe that it´s incredibly important
to update/create new user-stories each week! 


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can´t really say that i´ve done much to help anybody learn this week, except maybe by helping a teammate with git (again).
I will try to work more actively with this next week, by trying to bring some structure to our weekly sprint meeting 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I gave some suggestions for how we should update our process going forward. In future sprints i hope that we will be able to establish
a more functional work-process. In order to get there, i will discuss our process and make some changes together with the team next week 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I fixed a few minor errors and made it so that ads are properly updated. I also made it so you can delete/unclaim ads. 
I could have done more, and i will try to next week. By fixing our problems with the user-stories i hope there will be more to do then.
