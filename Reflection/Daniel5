Individual reflection 5, Daniel Aryan{

what do I want to learn or understand better?
At the beginning of this week we as a group made certain changes to our process in order to address some of the issues that we have had
throughout this project. These actions include holding a proper sprint startup meeting where we properly wrote new/assigned user stories
and broke them down into tasks. We also started holding daily-scrum meeting every day during the sprint. All of this had a tremendously
positive effect on our productiveness. Therefore i´ve learnt how important it is to properly plan your project and how important it is to 
maintain effective communication within the team. I´ve also gained a tremendous newfound respect for the Scrum process, and going forward
i will try to learn how to successfully implement more parts of the Scrum process in order to further improve our process. 


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have, together with the group, learnt the importance of planning the sprints. I´ve helped the others learn this by contributing
during the sprint-planning meeting.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have given suggestions and discussed our process with the team, and have helped contributed in the breakdown/writing/assigning of
user-stories. I think that these actions have greatly improved our productiveness and that my contribution was helpful in implementing
these changes. Therefore i will continue to be active in group discussions and project planning in the future. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My bachelor's thesis was due this week, which led to me decreasing my velocity a bit. Therefore my deliveries this week are a bit limited 
in comparison to a few of my teammates. Still, i have made some changes to the itemdetailswindow (made it abstract, defined subclasses,
and designed a new window for myPostings)
