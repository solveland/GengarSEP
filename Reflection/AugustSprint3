Reflection sprint3{

what do I want to learn or understand better
For the last sprint i want to continue learning about agile development and focus less on the technical aspect. We just now learned
about the value of kpis and even though it's a bit late to introduce new ones, i can hopefully still get a better understanding of
how the would have helped during this project. There isn't anything specific i would like to learn for the last sprint but more so
get an even better understanding of agile development.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope to be able to find time during the last week to make sure everything is up to par with the project. I feel like i have a good
understanding of our application and can therefore assist my team. It's also hard to be specific this week since it's the end of the project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've tried to contribute by actively discussing what agile practices we can use now that we've solved our issues with the planning phase.
I also followed the changes that we discussed at the sprint startup and was thorough with doing pull requests etc. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've worked on the map, parsed data and made the recycling functionality. I also contributed to our daily scrum meetings and reflection.
Besides the functionality that i've developed my main contribution is during discussions where i always try to express my takes on issues.
