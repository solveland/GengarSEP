Reflection week 3{

what do I want to learn or understand better?
We extended our sprint and during this time i learned to use the database which i mentioned last time. I feel like i have developed
a good understanding about android development and the tools that are commonly used in android studio. Right now i can't think of any
specific things that i want to learn or understand better since i had the tools to complete the tasks assigned to me. 


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I did assist two of my team members by helping them understand our application during this period. I try to engage with them if
they have troubles with their tasks although there haven't been many issues yet. I also assisted with some things concerning github, 
this probably wont be an issue in the future though. Keeping good communication with the team members hopefully leads to more opportunities.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We decided that we would try to use this extra bit of time to tie the knot on the first sprint. We failed to use scrum properly at the
start and therefore it was important for us all to complete our assigned tasks. This leads to us having a "fresh start" for the next sprint
and I contributed by doing just so. I have also made sure to use the scrum board properly. I will continue to take part in discussions
concerning this subject and hopefully that will be a factor in us improving our use of scrum.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I fixed some minor issues in our application such as messages not showing. Me and Anthony developed the message system for the ads.
I also implemented timestamps which allows the users to see when an ad was posted. Finally i contributed in the decision making process 
during our meetings and to our new project design template. I now feel like both my own and my teammates contribution have improved.
