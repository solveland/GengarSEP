Individual reflection 4 (extended sprint), Daniel Aryan{

what do I want to learn or understand better?
We decided to extend our first sprint to this week, as we felt we had not accomplished what we felt was neccecary for the sprint 
during the first week. As such, i feel like i´ve been quite inactive during this extended sprint, as my teammates wanted to complete
their respective tasks on their own. Therefore i can´t really say that i´ve learnt much this week, except maybe that it´s very easy for
the communication within a group to break down if you do not work to maintain it. I feel mostly caught up in the technical details by 
now though and will work more actively next sprint.


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can´t really say that i´ve done much to help anybody learn this week, except maybe by helping a teammate with git. I will work more 
actively with this next week, mainly by encouraging and initiating meetings and talks between teammates. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My teammates wanted to take some time to finish their respective tasks this week and i took on a more passive role where i was
available for support but didn´t do much programming myself. Next week i will once again take on a more active role and start claiming
tasks

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I fixed a few minor errors and made a popup-window where you can post ads. I could have done more, and i will next week, but for now
it feels like it was a good decision to step back and let my teammates get more aquainted with the code.
